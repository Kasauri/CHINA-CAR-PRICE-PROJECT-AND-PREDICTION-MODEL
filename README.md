# CHINA-CAR-PRICE-PROJECT-AND-PREDICTION-MODEL
PROBLEM
A Chinese automobile company Geely Auto aspires to enter the Nigerian market by setting up its manufacturing unit and producing cars locally to compete with their Nigerian, US and European counterparts. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the pricing of cars in the Nigerian market, since those may be very different from the Chinese market.The company wants to know:
1. Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a car
2. How well do those variables describe the price of a car
OBJECTIVE
To model the price of cars with the available independent variables. The management will use it to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables. They can accordingly manipulate the design of the cars, the business strategy etc. to meet certain price levels. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.
